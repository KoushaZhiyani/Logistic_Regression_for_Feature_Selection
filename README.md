# Logistic_Regression_for_Feature_Selection

To find the best features in logistic regression, the correlation coefficient is used, but the high number of features causes many situations. Finding the best features takes a lot of time. So I wrote a program that semi-automatically takes the address of the Excel file and the target column and the maximum number of columns and returns the best case in terms of the number and list of features for us.
Note: The result of this code may not be the best, but it is in the list of the best
